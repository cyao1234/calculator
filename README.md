# calculator

This is a small one hour project, not really something to be published but just for me. 

I need a calculator often, but fireing up a google calculator is a pain in the ass and the apple one is too clumsy. 

Plus when I am doing integer arithmatics, I do __NOT__ need floating points.

# Building
```
$ c++ main.cpp -o calc -std=c++23 -O3
```

# Usage
```
$ ./calc
```

# Misc

One expression at a time (as my needs)
